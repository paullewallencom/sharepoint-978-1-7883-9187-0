## About the Video Course
In the first section of this course we will start by providing a brief overview of SharePoint platform and its use scenarios, before moving on to set up our development environment, as well as Office 365 30-day developer trial tenant. Next, we’ll incrementally cover different customization scenarios and their entry points, such as CEWP, asset library file hosting, SharePoint Designer and SharePoint-hosted Add-Ins. We will explore how add-in model can be used to provision multiple components that will later work together to deliver custom functionality to users.We will finish with looking at different UI customization strategies and how those can be applied to tailor the look and feel of your functionality.
